# Toss-Simulator

This is a simple coin toss game implemented using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI, Pillow (PIL) for image handling, and pygame for playing sound effects.

## Description

The game allows the player to simulate tossing a coin. It displays a random image of either heads or tails, accompanied by a sound effect. The player can then choose to toss the coin again.
