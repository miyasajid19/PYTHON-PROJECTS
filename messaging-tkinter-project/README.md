-------------------------


The Tkinter Messaging App is a simple messaging application built using Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python. This application facilitates communication between users by providing a platform for registration, login, and real-time chatting with other registered users.

Key Features:
------------------------


User Registration: New users can register by providing their email, setting a password, and choosing a username. The email serves as the primary identification key.

User Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password to access the messaging features.

Chat Functionality: Once logged in, users can select a friend from their list of contacts and start chatting in real-time. Previous chat history is loaded if available, otherwise, a new chat file is created to store messages.

Simple and Intuitive Design: The application features a user-friendly interface designed to be easy to navigate and use.

Please note that this application is a sample project, and while it provides basic messaging functionality, it may not have advanced features typically found in full-fledged messaging applications.
