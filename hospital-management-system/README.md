This hospital management system, developed using Tkinter, encompasses key functionalities such as appointment taking, granting and prescribing for existing patients in the database.
Although there is potential to incorporate additional features such as integrating medical records and treatment details into the database, the primary emphasis has been on maintaining the entirety of the project within a single file and managing code length, which exceeds 800 lines. Consequently, while the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle hasn't been fully adhered to, and the code predominantly follows a procedural paradigm. It is presumed that the requisite databases and tables have been pre-established for the program's operation.
